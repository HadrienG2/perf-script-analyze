Just a throwaway Rust program that I wrote to analyze anomalies in samples from
the Linux perf profiler.

Definitely not production-quality code (zero tests, many unwraps and pretty ugly
statistics analysis at the end), but it did the job for my study, and might be
of interest to other perf users. So I'm publishing it.
